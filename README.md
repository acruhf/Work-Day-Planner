# Work-Day-Planner

## Description
For this assignment I made a workday hourly task list with a dynamically generated display with the ability to save list items in local storage. The code is based on an array that divides the 8 hours into an array that includes an am/pm attribute distinction so times could be represented in 12-hour format. Each row is generated based off the array of hours and divided into columns displaying the time, editable text area, and a save button to put that specific text into local storage. The text is assigned with an id corresponding to the hour so that saved tasks will display in their appropriate row. The text area column is also given a class that designates using a custom background color whether those tasks are in the past, present hour, or future.
